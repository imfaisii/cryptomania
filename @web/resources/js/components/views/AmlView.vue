        <h6>16. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy</h6>
  
        <p>16.1. CryptoMania has a zero-tolerance policy against money laundering, terrorism financing, and any other activity involving illicit financial transactions. As part of this commitment, CryptoMania strictly enforces compliance with all relevant Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and regulations to prevent its services from being misused for unlawful purposes.</p>
  
        <p>16.2. By registering an account and using our services, you agree that CryptoMania may conduct thorough identification, verification, and ongoing monitoring procedures in accordance with AML regulations. This includes but is not limited to verifying your name, address, date of birth, and the source of your funds.</p>
  
        <p>16.3. CryptoMania reserves the right to request additional information or documentation at any time to ensure full compliance with AML standards. Failure to provide accurate information or refusal to comply with these requests may lead to the suspension or termination of your account. In such cases, CryptoMania reserves the right to freeze any funds in your account until compliance requirements are met.</p>
  
        <p>16.4. Any suspicious activity, including unusual account behavior or transactions that may indicate money laundering or terrorism financing, will be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities without prior notification to the user. CryptoMania will cooperate fully with law enforcement and government agencies, providing any information required to aid in investigations or compliance.</p>
  
        <p>16.5. CryptoMania reserves the right to freeze or hold funds in any account where suspicious activity is detected, pending further investigation. Funds may remain frozen indefinitely until a conclusive resolution is reached, and CryptoMania reserves the right to forfeit these funds if they are found to be associated with illegal activities.</p>
  
        <p>16.6. You are responsible for notifying CryptoMania promptly of any updates to your personal information, including changes in name, address, and sources of funds. All information provided to CryptoMania must be truthful and up-to-date. Any discrepancies may trigger further investigation, and failure to provide accurate information may result in account suspension and asset freezing.</p>
  
        <p>16.7. For users residing in high-risk jurisdictions or exhibiting unusual account activity, CryptoMania may implement enhanced due diligence procedures. Enhanced due diligence may include but is not limited to verifying additional documentation, monitoring transaction patterns, or requiring verification of the source of funds for certain transactions.</p>
  
        <p>16.8. Upon account closure or in cases where suspicious activity is suspected, CryptoMania may require the user to submit to enhanced due diligence checks. Any failure to comply with this process may result in the indefinite withholding or forfeiture of assets to ensure compliance with AML policies.</p>
  
        <p>16.9. CryptoMania reserves the right to update and enhance its AML Policy as regulatory requirements evolve. The latest version of the AML policy will always be available on our website. By continuing to use our services, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to any updated AML requirements.</p>
  
        <p>16.10. CryptoMania may terminate or restrict access to its services at any time for users who attempt to circumvent AML regulations, use masking methods such as VPNs to conceal identity or location, or engage in any form of fraudulent, collusive, or otherwise suspicious behavior. Any assets associated with these actions may be immediately frozen or forfeited at CryptoManiaâ€™s discretion, and applicable authorities will be promptly notified.</p>
